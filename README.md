# Competitive Programming with A2SV

Welcome to the Competitive Programming repository, the journey I embarked on when I joined the A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) program. These are a collection of LeetCode questions I have solved.

## About Competitive Programming

Competitive programming is not just a pastime; it's a powerful tool for developing your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding abilities. It's a sport of solving algorithmic and computational problems under strict time constraints.

## LeetCode Questions

Within this repository, you'll discover a collection of LeetCode questions:

- **Arrays and Strings:** Questions involving array and string manipulation and processing.
- **Matrices:** Challenges focused on matrix manipulation and traversal.
- **Two Pointers:** Problems that require a two-pointer approach to optimize solutions.
- **Sliding Window:** Questions that involve using a sliding window technique to solve problems efficiently.
- **Stack and Queue:** Problems related to stack and queue data structures and their applications.
- **Trees:** Tree traversal, binary search trees, and other tree-related challenges.
- **Recursion:** Challenges that leverage recursive solutions to solve complex problems.
- **Backtracking:** Problems that involve exploring multiple possibilities to find a solution.
- **Graphs:** Graph traversal and algorithmic problems, essential for mastering graph-related challenges.
