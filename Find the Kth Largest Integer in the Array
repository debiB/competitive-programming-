/* -> this opreator is used to separate the prameters from the expression. 
In this case, the parameters are a and b and the expression is the ternary opreation that comes after it. Arrays.sort() method can have two 
parameters. The second one is comparator: we can define a method of sorting 
in this parameter. For example, if we were to use arrays.sort() function in this instance. 
it will just compare the first elements of the array. i.e "23" < "9". since 2 is compared with 9.
Therefore, we have to provide a means of comaprision: given the same length compare the contents if not consider the length*/
